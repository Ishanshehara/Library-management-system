Library management system

The Library Management System is a Java-based application designed to manage and automate the day-to-day operations of a library. The system allows librarians and administrators to efficiently handle book records, member information, and borrowing transactions. It eliminates the need for manual record keeping and provides a fast, reliable way to manage library resources.

Developed using Java and integrated with a relational database (such as MySQL), this system ensures secure and organized data storage. It supports key functionalities like adding new books, updating records, deleting entries, issuing and returning books, and viewing member details. The system also tracks due dates and maintains transaction history to help monitor book circulation.

The user-friendly interface and structured database connectivity (via JDBC) make the system efficient and easy to use. It is suitable for both small and medium-sized libraries seeking a digital solution to manage their operations.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of Object-Oriented Programming, database management, and Java-MySQL integration. Future improvements may include adding user authentication, report generation, and a graphical interface using JavaFX or Swing for enhanced usability.
